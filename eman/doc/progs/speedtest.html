<p><h3>This program runs a set of speed tests on the current machine.</h3>
speedtest  ...


<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>speedtest
<h3>Description</h3>
<P>This program runs a set of speed tests in the current computer. It should
have at least 1 unloaded processor, and minimal i/o occuring when this
is run. It will give a single value which should be generally proportional
to how fast refine will run on a given computer. It is a 'real world' test,
in that it simulates a variety of actual operations performed by a 
refinement procedure. Don't compare values given by speed test in
different versions of EMAN, since the underlying routines may be
improved with time.
