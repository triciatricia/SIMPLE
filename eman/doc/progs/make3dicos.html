<h3>Description</h3>
<P>Experimental - works, but not perfectly. make3d is better (but much slower)
<P>This program is used to build a 3d model from a set of projections/class
averages. The individual projections must already have assigned euler
angles.
<P>Reconstructions are performed in Fourier space. This causes certain
artifacts to appear in the 3d model. These artifacts can be reduced
by padding the images in real space. 50% padding produces excellent
results in most cases, ie - an 80x80 image would be padded to 120x120.
This would be specified with 'pad=120'. 25% padding provides adequate
results in most cases. The other artifact is caused by interpolation
in Fourier space. 'make3d' supports 6 levels of interpolation. Type
1 is 'nearest neighbor' interpolation and is very fast, but produces
significant artifacts. The default in most cases is type 2, which 
generally produces the best
all-around results. If you have a very small number of slices, you
might try mode=5. This effect can be observed qualitatively using the 
<a href=v4.html>v4</a> program.
This program allows you to interactively select the interpolation
mode used for generating forward projections of a 3d model. The artifacts
in v4 are more severe, but qualitatively similar to those produced
by Fourier reconstruction.
<P>Finally, since Fourier reconstruction DOES produce some undesirable
artifacts, generally this is just used as a preliminary model. Once
this model has been generated, typically this model will be improved
using a real-space iterative technique. This is implimented in
<a href=make3diter.html>make3diter</a>.
