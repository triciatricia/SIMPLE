startcsym  &lt;centered particles> &lt;# to keep> [sym=&lt;c?>] [imask=&lt;rad>] [nosym] [fixrot=&lt;side angle>]


<h3>Parameters:</h3>

<tr><td>&lt;# to keep></td><td>Number of particles to use for each view</td></tr>
<tr><td>[sym=&lt;c?>]</td><td>Symmetry of model</td></tr>
<tr><td>[imask=&lt;rad>]</td><td>Inside mask used to exclude inside regions</td></tr>
<tr><td>[nosym]</td><td>Skips the initial symmetry search</td></tr>

</table><br><h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>startcsym start.hed 50 sym=c7
<h3>Description</h3>
<P>This program uses a very simple technique to generate a VERY rough 3d
model from a set of particle images. It seaches for particles with the
best n-fold rotational symmetry ('top' view), and for other particles
with good mirror symmetry, but poor n-fold rotational symmetry ('side'
views). It generates class averages for each of these two views, then
generates a 3D model based on them.
<P>Specify the number of particles to use for each view. This number should
be at least 10-20, and at most ~10% of the total particle data set.
50-100 is good for typical data sets of 2000 or more particles.
<P>This routine will not work well for all data sets. Sometimes the relative
orientation of the side view will come out wrong, and will need to
be manually adjusted with the 'fixrot' parameter. Sometimes it won't
work at all, and startAny will have to be used.
