<h3>Description</h3>
<P><b>WARNING: the definition of resolution changed between build 34 and 35</b>
<P>This will generate a 3D MRC map from a PDB file. This may be used by <a href=align3d.html>
align3d</a> or <a href=foldhunter.html>foldhunter</a>, or for other purposes. The solvate
option is better than that used by some other similar programs, but is NOT discrete
water molecule solvation. It is still an approximate continuous method which still
produces artifacts. In addition, without solvation, the program can generate models at any
resolution, but with solvation, resolution must be 1.5 A or better.
<P>The purpose of [sym=<cn|dn|icos>] is mainly for generating full icosahedral virus structure,
since the PDB files for some viruses (bluetongue virus) only have non-crystallographic symmetry
transform matrix for half of the virus, we need to apply additional symmetry operation (for bluetongue
virus use sym=c2) to generate the full structure. For bluetongue virus, the C2 is
not enough, it requires another rotation along Z axis to make the the XYZ all on 2-fold
axes, so [rot=<alt,az,phi>] is added for this purpose to tranform the coordinates instead
tranform of density map later on.
<P>The solvate option works best with apix=.8 and res=2.4. The approximation becomes worse if 
res<3*apix. This will take some time to calculate, and is only an approximation.
