<p><h3>This performs refinement on a set of 3D models simultaneously</h3>
multirefine  &lt;total iter> &lt;# models> [sym=&lt;sym0>,&lt;sym1>,etc. []


<h3>Parameters:</h3>
<br><table border=3><tr><td>&lt;total iter></td><td>As in refine</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;# models></td><td>The number of 3D models being refined</td></tr>
<tr><td>[sym=&lt;sym0>,&lt;sym1>,etc.</td><td>[sym=&lt;sym0>,&lt;sym1>,etc.]</td></tr>
<tr><td>[]</td><td>see refine for other options</td></tr>
<h3>Description</h3>
<P><I>NOTE: This program is still experimental</i>
<P>This program operates almost identically to <a href=refine.html>refine</a>. The difference
is, this program will simultaneously refine several models from a single set of raw
images. That is, each particle will be grouped with one of the N models. In this way,
a heterogeneous data set can be separated into multiple models simultaneously. This can also
be used in some cases to filter out partially denatured proteins, etc. The options for this 
program are almost the same as those for refine, with the addition of the 2nd parameter
which specifies the number of models being refined.
<P>Rather than putting a single threed.0a.mrc file in the run directory, a subdirectory should
be made for each starting model, called '1', '2', etc. Each directory should then contain
a different threed.0a.mrc file.
<P>You may specify a (different) enforced symmetry for each of the models to be refined
this can help in a situation where the exact symmetry is unknown. It is a poor idea to
refine one model with some symmetry and another model with no (C1) symmetry at all. However
2 different symmetries, like c8 and c9 would be fine. That is, the completely asymmetric model
is a special case which may cause odd behavior in a multiple refinement unless ALL models
have no symmetry (and in certain cases even then).
