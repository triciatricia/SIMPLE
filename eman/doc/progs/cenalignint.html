<h3>Description</h3>
<P>Cenalignint is used to take a set of boxed particles and move each
particle to the center of its box (+- 1 pixel). This is accomplished by
iteratively aligning each particle to a rotationally averaged image which
is the average of all of the particles. This process may not work well for
all particles. It typically works very well on objects with high symmetry
(icosahedral viruses), and seems to work well on many objects with lower
symmetry. Note that this program does only integer pixel translations,
so no interpolation is done.
<P>This program is not used by the standard refinement proceedure, but can
be used manually before the refinement loop for several purposes: 1)
After centering the particles it may be possible to reduce the size (in
pixels) of the entire particle set. This will reduce the processing time
in the refinement process.  2) Some unusable particles can be eliminated
so processor time isn't wasted on them later.  3) The refinement loop
may work a little better/converge faster if the particles start out near
the center of their boxes.
<P>If, during the iterative loop, a particle does not seem to align
to a consistent center, that particle is discarded and written to
'bad.hed'. All sucessfully aligned images are written to 'ali.hed'. The
reference image used for alignment after each iteration is stored in
'avg.hed'. This file can be examined to see if convergence really has
been reached.
<P>This process generally works better if the references, and eventually
the particles, can be masked during each step. The mask radius should
be specified so the mask is just larger than the largest axis of your
particle.
