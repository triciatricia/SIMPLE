<p><h3>This program generates a preliminary 3d model for objects with octahedral symmetry</h3>
startoct  &lt;centered particles> &lt;# to keep> [nosym]


<h3>Parameters:</h3>
<br><table border=3><tr><td>&lt;centered particles></td><td>Raw centered particles to use to build a model</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;# to keep></td><td>Number of particles to use for each view</td></tr>
<tr><td>[nosym]</td><td>Skips the initial symmetry search</td></tr>
</table><br><h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>startoct start.hed 50
<h3>Description</h3>
<P>This program uses a very simple technique to generate a VERY rough 3d
model from a set of particle images. It seaches for particles with the
best 4-fold rotational symmetry. It generates class averages for this 
view, then generates a 3D model based on it.
<P>Specify the number of particles to use. This number should
be at least 10-20, and at most ~10% of the total particle data set.
50-100 is good for typical data sets of 2000 or more particles.
<P>This routine will not work well for all data sets. Sometimes it won't
work at all, and startAny will have to be used.
