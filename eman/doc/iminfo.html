<P><B>Description</B>
<BR>This program displays some information about a single or multi-image
file. Without the 'all' option, a count of the images in the file, and
the image size is displayed. With 'all', the euler angles, number of images
represented by each image in the file (mainly for class averages) and the
image title. At the end, a count of images represented by the images in
the file is displayed.
<P>This point may need some further explanation. When a classes.hed is
generated by classalignall, the number of images used to generate each
class average is stored with each image. If reference images are also stored
in this file, the image count for these is set to -1. The 'all' option
lets you see this image count for each class average in the file, as well
as see the total number of images represented by all of the class averages
in the file.
