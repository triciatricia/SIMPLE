<h2> Download EMAN</h2>
    Please contact me if you run into any problems. Happy reconstructing.    
<p>Downloads are currently only available through <a href=http://ncmi.bcm.tmc.edu/>the NCMI's web site</a>. You will
  be requested to provide your name/institution when you download a new version.
  This request is for grant reporting purposes, to justify continued support for
software  development. We will not provide your name or personal information
to outside  entities other than the granting agency. Please help us keep
our grant support by providing accurate information. <br>
   &nbsp; </p>

<h2><b>Binary</b></h2>

<p><b><i>Note for experienced sysops:</i></b><br>
<i>By default, EMAN is installed in your home directory, this way no root
privliges are required. If you wish to install EMAN in a central location,
either use /usr/local/EMAN, - OR - each user must set the 'EMANDIR' environment
variable to point to the main EMAN directory. /usr/local/EMAN will be checked
by default. If there are still problems with a central installation, users
can try making a symbolic link so EMAN appears to be in their home directory.</i><br>
</p>
<p>Installation: </p>

<pre>cd ~
tar xvzf eman.[version].tgz
-or-
zcat eman.[version].tgz | tar xvf -
<br></pre>
The EMAN binary releases now come with an installer script. Run EMAN/eman-installer
and follow the corrections to update your login script. 
<p>If you prefer to do this manually, you will need to set LD_LIBRARY path to point
to EMAN/lib, set the PATH to include EMAN/bin, and set PYTHONPATH to point to EMAN/lib,
wherever these files reside.

<p>EMAN binaries used to require making changes to various shared libraries provided
with the distribution. EMAN now uses a semi-static linking proceedure which means that
a single EMAN binary will run on most linux variants. Note that there are limits,
particularly old linux distributions will not work properly with EMAN, even with
a recompile. EMAN now requires Python 2.2 or newer, regardless of platform.</p>

<h2> Source</h2>
<p>As of version 1.4, EMAN is switching from GNU configure to CMake for cross-platform configuration.
While this does add an extra step to the compilation process, installing CMake is
quite trivial. CMake has proven to be much more reliable than configure. CMake can
be downloaded from www.cmake.org, or may be included as an optional package with your OS.
<p>   
   
<p>EMAN has been verified to compile on SGIs, Mandrake Linux 9.0-10.2, Redhat Linux
9.0, FC 1-3, Gentoo, under Windows using Cygwin (with some effort), and under OS X (buggy). 
It is possible to partially compile under earlier linux versions, but Python support will be unavailable, which will
limit some features. It may compile and run on Alphas, but due to some hardware
restrictions inherent to this platform, we cannot make any guarentees. AIX is also
partially supported. Please let us know if you have difficulty compiling EMAN.<br>
 </p>
<p>Platform specific notes:
<ul>
<LI>Mandrake 10.0+, or (possibly) other KDE3.2 platforms: Use the appropriate option in ccmake to resolve QT problems</LI>
<LI>for OSX, make sure you are using the X11 version of QT</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Test Data</h2>

<p>Here is the data set used in testing the program as described in our first
 EMAN paper (JSB 1999). It is QUITE large. Don't download it unless you really
 want it. I will also make the data from our 11.5 A GroEL reconstruction (JMB
 2001) available upon request. </p>

  - This is a gzipped tar file, although it may not be obvious from the filespec
when it is downloaded.   </p>
