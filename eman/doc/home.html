<p><i><b>NOTE:</b></i><b> EMAN
includes the AIRS (Analysis of
Intermediate Resolution Structure)
programs, including foldhunter (docking) and ssehunter (secondary
structure identification).
Many of these tools have been integrated with Chimera in this release.</b>
</p>

<p>EMAN is a complete software package for reconstructing 3d
models
from a
set of randomly oriented particle images. This technique is typically
used in conjunction with images of individual molecules collected using
electron cryomicroscopy. This technique is capable of determining
subnanometer resolution structures of particles in the 10-1000 nm
range. The core of EMAN is a Python-enabled scientific image processing
library which may be useful for other fields as
well. EMAN also incorporates a number of tools for docking x-ray
crystal structures
into lower resolution density maps.<br>

</p>

<p>EMAN2 is currently under development, and pre-alpha versions
can be
downloaded from the NCMI website. EMAN1 remains the stable platform for
performing reconstructions.<br>

</p>

<p>EMAN is provided free of charge as a service to the scientific
community. One of it's biggest advantages is ease of use. An
inexperienced image processor should be able to download the EMAN
package, and begin a 3d reconstruction almost immediately. An entire 3d
model refinement can be run with a single command. Understanding the
details will obviously take a bit of time, but the user can start
producing useful results almost immediately. </p>
