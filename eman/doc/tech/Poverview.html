Overview of EMAN for Programmers</H2>
All of the common routines in EMAN are contained in the shared archive
libEM.so. This includes the <A HREF="Pemdata.html">EMData</A>, <A HREF="Peuler.html">Euler</A>
and <A HREF="Plist.html">List</A> C++ objects as well as common routines
such as the FFT library. The EMData object is the primary object you will
use to access and process EM data. This object contains parallel-safe routines
for reading/writing a variety of common EM file formats, performing FFTs,
masking, 3d model construction, etc. The single EMData object can deal
with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional data.
<P>The Euler object is used to store either the orientation of a slice
in the overall volume or the absolute orientation of a volume data set.
This class provides routines for converting euler angles to/from a variety
of different conventions (Imagic, quaternion, Spider, etc.), as well as
routines for 'multiplication', a symmetry iterator, etc.
<P>The List object is a very basic object for storing lists of pointers.
It doesn't even use prototypes currently.&nbsp; For programs with a GUI,
the QList object would probably be a better choice, but for non-graphical
programs List is more consistent.
<P>Graphical user intefaces for EMAN programs are all implimented using
the <A HREF="http://www.troll.no">QT&nbsp;toolkit</A>, along with a library
of widgets called <A HREF="http://ncmi.bcm.tmc.edu/~stevel/qscilib/index.html">QSciLib</A>.
The QT toolkit is a semi-commercial, C++ based GUI&nbsp;toolkit with many
attractive features. First, it is free for use in non-commercial software
written under Unix/X-windows. A version of the toolkit also exists for
win95/NT, which means any applications you write for X using the toolkit
can be trivially ported to Win95. The Win95 version of QT is not free,
but they offer a per-developer license with no distribution licenseing
fees. Second, the toolkit offers an exceptionally good model for inter-object
communications called Signals and Slots. This mechanism permits objects
to communicate seamlessely without knowing of each other's existance.

What you will need:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
EMAN source distribution</LI>

<LI>
QSciLib distribution</LI>

<LI>
QT Toolkit</LI>

<LI>
netPBM (if 8 bit formats like GIF, TIFF, etc... will be used)</LI>

<LI>
C++ compiler</LI>
</UL>
The QT&nbsp;Toolkit, as a semi-commercial package, will compile trivially
on just about any Unix/X system around. It even supports a variety of compilers
on each platform.
<P>QSciLib and EMAN have currently been tested only under IRIX&nbsp;(SGI)
and Linux (any CPU should be ok). Machine independance was a major goal
when EMAN was being developed, but porting to other platforms is likely
to require a few trivial changes, like changes in include file names, etc.
If you do port the code to another platform, please send me a list of patches
and I'll merge it into the general source for the next release. In theory,
most of the code should even be portable to Win 95, but we haven't purchased
a QT license for Win 95.
