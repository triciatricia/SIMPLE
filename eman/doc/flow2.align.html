<H4>Align and Average Particles</H4>
The set of particles within each class is iteratively aligned and averaged to create
a class-average. One class is associated with each reprojection from
the previous step. Each reprojection is expected to look similar, but not
identical to the corresponding class-average generated in this step. The alignment
is performed by aligning each particle to the reprojection. The aligned particles
are then averaged together, possibly with CTF amplitude correction and Wiener filtration.
This average then serves as a new alignment reference. This process allows the
class average to diverge substantially from the reprojection. The process
continues for a fixed number of iterations which generally approaches convergence.
