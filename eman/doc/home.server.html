<p>EMAN is a complete software package for reconstructing 3d models from
a set of randomly oriented projections. This is primarily aimed at the
electron cryomicroscopy / single particle analysis community, but many
of the utilities and (for programmers) objects can be applied to other
image processing problems.
<p>EMAN is provided free of charge as a service to the scientific community.
One of it's biggest advantages is ease of use. An inexperienced image processor
should be able to download the EMAN package, and begin a 3d reconstruction
almost immediately. An entire 3d model refinement can be run with a single
shell command. Understanding the details will obviously take a bit of time,
but the user can start producing useful results almost immediately.
<p>EMAN is designed with a 3-tier structure. At the highest level is a
set of GUI (graphical user interface) programs which should allow anyone,
even an image processing/EM novice, to perform a 3d reconstruction from
scratch. The GUI includes utilities for CTF fitting and correction, browsing
image files, examining the EMAN command history, etc.
<p>The middle tier consists of a set of command line utilites which perform
most of the actual processing in the package. Individual programs will
do operations like reproject 3d models, classify particles, align particles,
etc.
<p>The lowest tier is a set of C++ objects which handle all of the most
common low level image processing operations necessary for cryo-EM work.
These objects can read/write images and 3d models in a variety of formats,
do FFTs, DWTs, filter, mask, align, etc. Most of the second tier programs
are just a few dozen lines of code. The real work is done in the underlying
objects which could easily be adapted to other tasks. FFT support is provided
by the (excellent)
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~fftw/">FFTW library</a>
written at MIT.
