<H3>Preliminary Model Generation</H3>
<H4>Determine the last euler angle</H4>
<P>This stage in generating a preliminary model is determining the
remaining undetermined euler angle for the symmetric class averages
determined in the last step. This step is performed as part of
<A HREF="progs/startcsym.html">startcsym</A> or <A HREF="progs/starticos.html">starticos</A>.</P>
<P>The symmetric particles are stored in sym.img by the previous
step. In the case of Cn (n-fold rotational) symmetry, the first class
average is a top view, and the second class average is a side view.
This statement specifies 2 of the 3 euler angles for the particle.
However, we don't know how the side view is aligned with respect to
the top view, so an unknown euler angle remains. This angle is
determined using a common-lines method at this stage. In the case of
icosahedral particles, the 3 class averages represent 5-fold, 3-fold
and 2-fold rotational symmetries. In this case, there is 1 unknown
euler angle for each particle.
