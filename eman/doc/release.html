<h2>EMAN Release Notes (1.9)</h2>
<P>EMAN1.9 is a bugfix release, intended as a final release of EMAN1
as it is gradually deprecated in favor of EMAN2. There were no
'major' changes in this release, strictly a large number of bugfixes
and small improvements made over the last 2 years. The fixes are
substantial enough that EMAN1.8 users should definitely upgrade to
this version.s</P>
<HR>
<h2>EMAN Release Notes (1.8)</h2>
<H3>Major changes in v1.8 :</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Substantial improvements in
	refine2d.py. Strongly suggest using refine2d.py on all new data sets
	before moving on to 3D reconstruction. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some programs use the EMAN2 style
	arguments ie - 'program &lt;file&gt; --option=value'&nbsp; rather
	than the old style 'program &lt;file&gt; option=value' 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New HDF5 format compatible with
	EMAN2. Data can be stored in HDF5 files in many different ways. EMAN
	1.9 will read both old (EMAN 1.7) HDF5 format files as well as new
	EMAN2 style HDF5 files. HDF5 writes are always in 'new' HDF5 format.
	Note that the current HDF I/O methods have poor performance on files
	with large numbers (~10,000 or more) of images in a single file.
	We're working on it...</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New AIRS programs, such as
	'skeleton' 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Initial support for
	tetrahedral/cubic symmetry (thx to David Woolford and Phil Baldwin).
	Not well tested yet.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New options to make refinement
	work better on large icosahedral objects. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Improvements in parallelism
	infrastructure, though network-related problems may still exist on
	some linux clusters (please report problems) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Fixed random model generation in makeinitialmodel.py 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Known bugs in the current version 
</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Some linux clusters seem to have ssh-related problems. The
	symptom is either the refine command unreproducibly 'freezing'
	during the 'classalignall' process. If this happens, you can run
	'killall ssh' on the node where refine is running, and the job will
	resume, though a few particles may be lost from the current
	reconstruction. The other problem is that you may observe some small
	fraction of the particles being missing from each iteration of the
	reconstruction. Both problems are relatively harmless, though
	annoying. Please report specific problems so we can try to establish
	what the unifying factor is...</P>

<h2>EMAN Release Notes (1.7)</h2>
<p>Welcome to EMAN 1.7.&nbsp; Remember the full online help
for
EMAN is always available by pressing the "HELP" button in <i>eman</i>.
Most of our development effort is now focused on the completely
revamped EMAN 2.0, though another release in the 1.x series is likely.<br>
</p>
<p>EMAN 1.7 has some major enhancements over 1.61.<br>
</p>
Major changes in v1.7<br>
<ul>
  <li>Major overhaul of parallelism infrastructure (runpar). Now uses
fileserver for both reads and writes in the cluster versions. Fault
tolerance has also improved. If a node dies during a run, the run will
continue, and simply stop using that node. Better job distribution to
nodes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Binary release for AMD64, and better support for OSX (still
imperfect).</li>
  <li>New program <span style="font-style: italic;">refine2d.py</span>
for generating reference-free class-averages from a set of particles.
Uses a combination of SVD and alignment. MUCH better than
startnrclasses.</li>
  <li>New program <span style="font-style: italic;">makeinitialmodel.py</span>
for constructing 3D models from blobs, good for making random or
deterministic shapes.</li>
  <li>Greatly expanded and improved <span style="font-weight: bold;">AIRS</span>
software with Chimera bindings. This includes tools for locating
secondary structure in intermediate resolution maps (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">ssehunter.py</span>), docking crystal
structures (<span style="font-style: italic;">foldhunter.py</span>),
and many other useful tools.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Support for both full and 1/2 maps for icosahedral reconstructions</li>
  <li>Support for exponential envelope functions in CTF correction
(normally Gaussian), email if to ask about this.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Major improvements to experimental 2D crystallography
preprocessing program (qindex)</li>
</ul>
Minor changes<br>
<ul>
  <li>PIF writer fixed</li>
  <li>Reader for 3D .dm3 files added (Digital Micrograph)</li>
  <li>AMIRA file format support (r/w)</li>
  <li>Fixed MRC/CCP4 compatibility problem</li>
  <li>Fixed SPIDER read for 1 image stacks</li>
  <li>Problem with A/pix adjustment when scaling fixed</li>
  <li>Improvements to <span style="font-style: italic;">tiltseries</span>
(simple tomography program), though the EMAN2 equivalent is much better.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<HR>
<h2>EMAN Release Notes (1.6)</h2>
Major changes in v1.60 : <br>
<ul>
  <li>dfilt option in refine works now. <b>This is the major cause for
the 1.6 release</b>. This option was used for our recent 6 A
reconstruction of GroEL, and we have been touting it as the best
current approach for doing EMAN reconstructions (which it is).
Unfortunately, due to an unfortunate error on my part, a critical
change never got updated in the EMAN source repository. So,
essentially, this option worked very well for me, but not for anyone
else. Anyone who was experimenting with the dfilt option
should give it another try. On the bright side, the bug wasn't causing
any harm, specifying dfilt in the buggy version
was almost equivalent to not specifying it at all. I apologize for this
nasty snafu.</li>
  <li>Better support for icosahedral reconstructions and for
reconstructions of large models (contact wjiang@bcm.tmc.edu for more
info)</li>
  <li>Some programs didn't like EMAN's MRC files. They should now be
properly CCP4 compliant.</li>
  <li>EM file format support was minimal in last version, now properly
handles stack files and byte-ordering</li>
  <li>New program <i>qplot</i> utility for plotting 2 column text
files.</li>
  <li>EMAN can now compile and run on Macs (again). OS 10.3 only, with
appropriate fink packages installed. This is still not officially
supported.</li>
  <li>The &gt;2G file support was apparently broken in v1.5. This has
been fixed.</li>
  <li>Improved 64-bit support for use on Athlon-64's and Opterons. This
is currently the fastest platform available for EMAN refinements
(and the most cost-effective)</li>
  <li>Support for KDE 3.2/Mandrake 10.0</li>
  <li>Fixed funny narrow display in some cases in asymmetric triangle
viewer</li>
  <li><i>fitctf</i> improved to work on a wider range of images,
including particles from CCD frames</li>
  <li>usefilt support in <i>multirefine</i></li>
  <li>MRC file i/o improved for use with chimera</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Known bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While we've fixed the majority of the lockup problems that
occured under OSX and a few other specific systems, there still seem to
be some problems running under RH9 with Gnome. KDE has no problems.
This seems to be a wierd incompatibility between QT and Gnome on this
platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EMAN Release Notes (1.4)</h2>
<p>Here's a list of the major changes in version 1.40: </p>
<ul>
  <li>3dit/3dit2 - A number of recent problems have been associated
with these options, and we have found that they are actually not
necessary in many cases. If you experience strange problems with your
3D models containing horizontal bands, or being completely black, try
not using these options. We are working to resolve this issue in a more
satisfactory way. If they
are necessary for your project (try running clean3d manually on a model
and
see if there is a substantial impact), look for an upcoming nightly
release
version to address this problem.</li>
  <li>Substantial improvements were made to EMAN's parallelism. When
used on small particles on a large number of processors, the previous
versions of EMAN would run at less than 100% capacity on each
processor. The new version should run at 100% on fairly large numbers
of CPUs.</li>
  <li>Python support - EMAN now officially supports Python scripting.
Some very powerful operations can be performed with some very simple
(and easy) scripts. Just to give you the flavor, here's a quick example
which will compare class-averages to projections:</li>
  <pre>python<br>from EMAN import *<br>img=readImages("classes.1.hed",-1,-1)<br>for i in range(0,len(img),2):<br>    print i," vs. ",i+1," -&gt; ",img[i].lcmp(img[i+1],1,0)[0]<br></pre>
  <li>New options in the <i>refine</i> command:
    <ul>
      <li>setsf=&lt;res&gt; - Will apply the user defined 1D structure
factor to the final reconstructed model after each iteration. This
represents the ultimate in CTF amplitude correction. While the 'ctfcw='
option does a
very good job of CTF correction, it does make certain assumptions which
aren't valid in all cases. If you have a reliable structure factor
(from x-ray solution scattering, or generated from a set of
micrographs), this option is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>refine - How confusing, an option with the same name as the
command. Normal alignments in EMAN classification are +- 1 pixel. This
option
will refine all 2D alignments to +-.05-.1 pixels. This can signficantly
improve classification accuracy for certain structures, and hence
improve resolution. In some cases it will have little or no effect.
There is a significant
speed penalty associated with this option.</li>
      <li>phasecls - This option will use signal to noise ratio
weighted phase residual as a classification criteria (instead of the
default optimized real space variance). Over the last year or so,
people working on cylindrical structures (like GroEL), have noticed
that 'side views' of this particle seem to frequently get classified as
being tilted 4 or 5 degrees from the side view. While apparently this
didn't effect the models significantly at the obtained resolution, it
is quite irritating. This problem turns out to be due to resolution
mismatch between the 3D model and the individual particles. Using phase
residual solves this problem, although it's unclear if there is any
resolution improvement. This option has a slight speed penalty</li>
      <li>fscls - An improvement, albeit an experimental one, over
phasecls. phasecls basically ignores Fourier amplitude when making
image comparisons. fscls will use a SNR weighted Fourier shell
correlation as a similarity criteria. Preliminary tests have shown that
this produces slightly better results than phasecls, but it should
still be used with caution.</li>
      <li>slow - This option tries to do an even better job of 2D
particle alignment. Used with the 'refine' option above, this option
uses fsc as a criteria during alignment. This is quite slow, but
theoretically even more
accurate.</li>
      <li>axialfilt=&lt;val&gt; - In theory, direct Fourier
reconstruction algorithms, such as the one used in EMAN are not
susceptible to problems with an excess of images in a particular set of
orientations. However, there are certain circumstances under which this
is not the case, and a certain amount of 'axial blurring' can occur.
This largely occurs with cylindrical particles where virtually all of
the data is in side views. Axialfilt can perform some empirical
corrections for this effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>qindex - a program for very basic indexing of 2D crystal images
was added. This program may be enhanced in future, depending on
community response.</li>
  <li>fitctf - improvements in fitting quality and accuracy. May still
have problems with some CCD data.</li>
  <li>procpdb.py - a script for basic manipulation of PDB files,
designed largely for use with <i>foldhunter</i></li>
  <li>foldhunter - new option added to generate rotated/translated PDB
files corresponding to the best fits</li>
  <li>multirefine - now permits a different symmetry to be specified
for each model. This is still an experimental option.</li>
  <li>building EMAN from source - We previously used GNU configure to
easily configure EMAN on any platform. Due to a variety of problems
with this system, we are now switching to 'CMake'. This is the
cross-platform configuration tool written as part of the ITK project.
If you wish to compile EMAN from source, please download and install
the cmake version provided on the EMAN required libraries download
page. The INSTALL text file will describe how to use it. GNU configure
is still present, but is deprecated.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
</ul>
As always, comments, suggestions and questions are always welcome. Just
email sludtke@bcm.tmc.edu.<br>
<br>
Good luck, and enjoy EMAN !<br>
