T2###You've finished the hard part now. Most of what remains
is waiting. You should now have a starting model in threed.0a.mrc and
a bunch of particle data in start.hed/img. This step will help
you get a refinement running.# #

#Reconstruction Resolution (Angstroms)
#This is the resolution you are trying to achieve. From the previous
step, you should have a better estimate of this value now. If you
aren't doing CTF correction, this is the resolution of the 1st zero of
the CTF. If you ARE doing CTF correction you should have determined
this number from the envelope functions of your data while using ctfit
in step 1. In both cases it's usually a good idea to start with a 
lower resolution than you hope to eventually achieve, then increase
it once you've got a good low resolution model. A good rule of thumb
is to start with about 1.5x worse resolution than you hope to achieve.#
