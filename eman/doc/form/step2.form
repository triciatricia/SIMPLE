T2###In the second step of the reconstruction you will take the set of
particles you prepared in the first step and generate a preliminary model
for use in step 3.# #

#Particle Symmetry (Cn, Dn, icos or unk)#
If you know the symmetry of your particle, enter it here. Cn symmetry
is a single n-fold axis of rotational symmetry. Dn symmetry is an axis
of rotational symmetry combined with another 2 fold axis 90 degrees from
the primary axis (actually a set of them). Icosahedral symmetry is 60-fold
symmetry with full 5-3-2 symmetry imposed. For asymmetric particles, enter
C1. If you don't know the symmetry of your particle enter 'unk' for now.#
