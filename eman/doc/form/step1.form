T1###EMAN will generate a customized set of instructions which will
take you through the single particle reconstruction process step by step.
Before using this form, insure that you ran 'eman' from the directory
where you plan to run your reconstruction. Then fill out the information
below. This will generate the first set of instructions.# #

Luser#Beginner,Expert#
#User Level
#If you are a beginner, this will provide a more
detailed set of instructions. Experts receive only
a basic checklist.#

Fvoltage#20,1200
##Microscope voltage (kV)
#The microscope voltage used when your recoreded your data.
You can leave this blank if not performing CTF correction.#

Fcsubs#.1,20
##spherical aberration (mm)
#This is a basic microscope parameter. If you're not performing CTF
correction, you can leave this blank. If you don't know this
number, ask someone who does.#

Fmag#1,100000
##Magnification in thousands
#Microscope magnification in 1,000x.#

Fscandpi#1,100000
##Scan step (dpi)
#This is the resolution used when scanning the micrographs.#

Fscan#1,100000
##Scan step (microns)
#This is the step size used when scanning the micrographs, or
alternatively the pixel size of your CCD camera if using
CCD frames.#

Fapix#.1,50,3
##Angstroms per pixel
#This is the effective per pixel sampling in the images
to be processed.#

Ipsize#0,100000
##Particle Size (angstroms)
#The approximate longest linear dimension of your particle.
If you have to guess, too high is better than too low.#

Ibsize#0,5000
##Box Size (pixels)
#The box size in pixels you plan to use for selecting particles.
This should be somewhat larger than the box, and it's a good
idea if it's a multiple of 8, or at least 4.#

Lctf#Full,1st Zero#
#CTF Correction
#The contrast transfer function of the microscope (CTF) can
be corrected fully using several micrographs taken at a range
of defocuses, or a rough structure can be generated without
CTF correction from micrographs at approximately the same
defocus. The second method will limit the resolution of
the reconstruction to the 1st zero of the CTF. Usually it's
a good idea to start with a 1st zero reconstruction, then
use this as a starting point for a fully corrected model.#

Fres#1,100
##Desired resolution in A (start low)
#This is the reconstruction resolution you will try to
achieve. If you have not done any analysis yet, make an
educated guess based on your microscope. Be somewhat
conservative. It is often best to start with a low
resolution reconstruction, then improve it.#

Iimage#0,40000
##Size of image to be boxed in pixels
#Enter the typical size in pixels of the images you
will be boxing particles from. For example if the typical
image is 4000x6000, enter 5000. This number need not
be exact. If you have already boxed your particles out
with other software, just enter zero here.#

Imemory#0,100000
##Memory (in megs/processor)
#The amount of memory on your computer. If you have
a multiprocessor shared memory machine, enter the
amount of memory per processor.#

Iproc#0,1024
##Available Processors
#The number of processors you expect to use on the machine
you will do the refinement on. Note that eman only supports
shared memory machines at this time. For typical computers this
will be 1.#

Ispeed#0,100000
##Speed test index
#Run 'speedtest' on the machine you plan to do your reconstructions
on. Make sure the machine is mostly idle when running this test. This
number will be used to estimate how much time a reconstruction will
require.#
