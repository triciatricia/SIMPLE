<H3>Preliminary Model Generation</H3>
<H4>Self Symmetry Search</H4>
<P>The second step in generating a preliminary model is a
self-symmetry search. This, and all of the remaining steps in
generating a preliminary model are performed automatically by
<A HREF="progs/startcsym.html">startcsym</A> or <A HREF="progs/starticos.html">starticos</A>.</P>
<P>In this stage, each particle is assigned a quality factor based on
its symmetry. Then the best particles with each required symmetry are
pulled out and stored in a separate files. For icosahedral symmetry,
5-fold, 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetries are searched for. For
particles with a single n-fold rotational symmetry, 2 views are
searched for. The top view will contain the Cn symmetry. The side
view will contain particles with a mirror symmetry (when n is even)
or a near-mirror symmetry (when n is odd). In this case particles are
also ranked based on how <I>poorly</I> the particle matches the Cn
symmetry.</P>
