<h1>Mathematical/Geometrical conventions in EMAN</h1>
<p>Perversely, we decided to add yet another Euler angle convention to
the
EM community (we did have a good reason at the time). However, on the
bright
side, the EMAN library has routines to convert to other conventions.
EMAN
uses a Z,X,Z&#8217; convention (Az, Alt, Phi). That is, first there is a
rotation about the Z axis, then about X, then about the new Z axis.
When viewing projections,
the convention is to look along the Z axis, so a 0,0,0 projection will
be
a &#8216;top&#8217; view of the particle. The three rotations are given the names
azimuth,
altitude and phi. In projection, phi represents rotation in the plane
of
the projection. For example, Alt=90 will produce a &#8216;side&#8217; view of the
particle,
and azimuth will rotate through the various possible side
views.&nbsp;The
C++/Python 'Euler' object contains code for converting between various
EM
Euler angle conventions. See libEM/Euler.C for rotation matrices, etc.</p>

Since all large biological molecules possess handedness, the only
symmetries
possible are:<br>

<br>
<p>The EMAN convention is for the axis with the highest symmetry to be
aligned
along Z. So, for a D8 symmetry, the 8-fold axis lies along Z, and the
asymmetric
triangle spans alt=[0,90] and az=[0,45]. For icosahedral symmetry, the
5-fold
lies along Z. Note that this differs from the MRC convention in which
2-folds
are aligned with x, y and z.</p>
