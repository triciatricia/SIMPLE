How to do a <FONT FACE="times">Reconstruction</FONT></H2>
This set of web pages will take you through the process of performing a
3D reconstruction from single particle data. These pages will assume that
you have a basic understanding of the principles of transmission electron
microscopy (cryo or negative stain). Each page will typically contain a
minimal outline of the steps you will need to perform, to provide a quick
summary for advanced users. Click on one of these outline steps to get
detailed instructions for that step. After the description, links to programs
associated with this step are provided in parentheses).

<P>When you begin doing a reconstruction, you will presumably start with
a set of scanned micrographs or CCD images. The first step in doing a reconstruction
is selecting the particles from the micrographs. This can be accomplished
with boxer (or one of the other programs above). All of the micrographs
must be scanned at the same resolution. The scan resolution should be at
least 3 times smaller than the highest resolution you wish to obtain, ie
- if you want a 9 &Aring; reconstruction, your scanned images should be
sampled at at least 3 &Aring;/pixel.
