<H2>How to do a Reconstruction</H2>
<H3>Particle with icosahedral symmetry</H3>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">WARNING:</FONT> While EMAN does have
support for icosahedral symmetry, it has not yet been tested or
optimized completely. It may work well, it may work poorly, it may
not work at all (depending on the particle). In the release version
this support should be more complete, with options for using
techniques specific to icosahedral particles. Feel free to experiment
with the current version, but please don't judge the program based on
the current state of icosahedral reconstructions!</I></P>
<P>The first step in performing an icosahedral reconstruction is
generating a preliminary model. This is accomplished by searching for
particles with 5 fold, 3 fold and 2 fold symmetry. These 3 views are
then used to construct an initial model which is then refined. No CTF
correction is done in this part of the procedure. The model generated
here is usually very bad. This is expected and is not a problem.
Don't expect this model to look anything like your final
reconstruction.</P>
