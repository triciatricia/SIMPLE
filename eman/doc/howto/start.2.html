<H2>How to do a <FONT FACE="times">Reconstruction</FONT></H2>
<P>This set of web pages will take you through the process of
performing a 3D reconstruction from single particle data. These pages
will assume that you have a basic understanding of the principles of
transmission electron microscopy (cryo or negative stain). Each page
will typically contain a minimal outline of the steps you will need
to perform, to provide a quick summary for advanced users. Click on
one of these outline steps to get detailed instructions for that
step. After the description, links to programs associated with this
step are provided in parentheses).</P>

<P>When beginning a reconstruction you should have some idea of the
particle's symmetry. If you know your particle's symmetry, select it
from the list below to continue. Sometimes, of course, this simply
isn't true. If you don't know your particle's symmetry, you can use
symeval to try to determine it. This may or may not give you a
conclusive answer. If the answer is inconclusive, the best approach
is typically to try a reconstruction with the most likely symmetry,
then once a few rounds of refinement are complete, continue refining
with no symmetry and see if the model maintains its symmetry.</P>
