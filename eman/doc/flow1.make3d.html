<H3>Preliminary Model Generation</H3>
<H4>Build a 3D model</H4>
<P>In the last stage of generating a preliminary model the 2 or 3
class averages from the previous step are used to build a 3D model.
This step is performed as part of <A HREF="progs/startcsym.html">startcsym</A>
or <A HREF="progs/starticos.html">starticos</A>.</P>
<P>In the previous step, euler angles were determined for the 2 or 3
class averages generated earlier. These images are then combined to
form a preliminary 3d model. This model, being based on only 2 or 3
images, will look really really bad. This is fine. The refinement
loop will generally converge with even a really bad starting model.
If you look at this model, don't be surprised that it looks bad. Just
take a leap of faith and try the refinement procedure.</P>
