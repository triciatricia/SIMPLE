<H2>EMAN Release Notes (1.9)</H2>
<P>EMAN1.9 is a bugfix release, intended as a final release of EMAN1
as it is gradually deprecated in favor of EMAN2. There were no
'major' changes in this release, strictly a large number of bugfixes
and small improvements made over the last 2 years. The fixes are
substantial enough that EMAN1.8 users should definitely upgrade to
this version.s</P>
<HR>
<H3>Major changes in v1.8 :</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Substantial improvements in
	refine2d.py. Strongly suggest using refine2d.py on all new data sets
	before moving on to 3D reconstruction. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some programs use the EMAN2 style
	arguments ie - 'program &lt;file&gt; --option=value'&nbsp; rather
	than the old style 'program &lt;file&gt; option=value' 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New HDF5 format compatible with
	EMAN2. Data can be stored in HDF5 files in many different ways. EMAN
	1.9 will read both old (EMAN 1.7) HDF5 format files as well as new
	EMAN2 style HDF5 files. HDF5 writes are always in 'new' HDF5 format.
	Note that the current HDF I/O methods have poor performance on files
	with large numbers (~10,000 or more) of images in a single file.
	We're working on it...</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New AIRS programs, such as
	'skeleton' 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Initial support for
	tetrahedral/cubic symmetry (thx to David Woolford and Phil Baldwin).
	Not well tested yet.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New options to make refinement
	work better on large icosahedral objects. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Improvements in parallelism
	infrastructure, though network-related problems may still exist on
	some linux clusters (please report problems) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Fixed random model generation in makeinitialmodel.py 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Known bugs in the current version 
</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Some linux clusters seem to have ssh-related problems. The
	symptom is either the refine command unreproducibly 'freezing'
	during the 'classalignall' process. If this happens, you can run
	'killall ssh' on the node where refine is running, and the job will
	resume, though a few particles may be lost from the current
	reconstruction. The other problem is that you may observe some small
	fraction of the particles being missing from each iteration of the
	reconstruction. Both problems are relatively harmless, though
	annoying. Please report specific problems so we can try to establish
	what the unifying factor is...</P>
</UL>
<H3>Major changes in v1.70 :</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dfilt option in refine works now.
	<B>This is the major cause for the 1.7 release</B>. This option was
	used for our recent 6 A reconstruction of GroEL, and we have been
	touting it as the best current approach for doing EMAN
	reconstructions (which it is). Unfortunately, due to an unfortunate
	error on my part, a critical change never got updated in the EMAN
	source repository. So, essentially, this option worked very well for
	me, but not for anyone else. Anyone who was experimenting with the
	dfilt option should give it another try. On the bright side, the bug
	wasn't causing any harm, specifying dfilt in the buggy version was
	almost equivalent to not specifying it at all. I apologize for this
	nasty snafu. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Better support for icosahedral
	reconstructions and for reconstructions of large models (contact
	wjiang@bcm.tmc.edu for more info) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some programs didn't like EMAN's
	MRC files. They should now be properly CCP4 compliant. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">EM file format support was minimal
	in last version, now properly handles stack files and byte-ordering 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New program <I>qplot</I> utility
	for plotting 2 column text files. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">EMAN can now compile and run on
	Macs (again). OS 10.3 only, with appropriate fink packages
	installed. This is still not officially supported. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &gt;2G file support was
	apparently broken in v1.5. This has been fixed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Improved 64-bit support for use on
	Athlon-64's and Opterons. This is currently the fastest platform
	available for EMAN refinements (and the most cost-effective) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support for KDE 3.2/Mandrake 10.0 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fixed funny narrow display in some
	cases in asymmetric triangle viewer 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>fitctf</I> improved to work on
	a wider range of images, including particles from CCD frames 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">usefilt support in <I>multirefine</I>
		</P>
	<LI><P>MRC file i/o improved for use with chimera 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>v1.5 - released 11/2003</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New refinement options, phasecls,
	fscls, dfilt and refine for much more accurate image classification 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prototype animation module for
	Chimera (undocumented) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bugfixes/improvements to PNG &amp;
	PGM writing 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">MRC output now more comapatible
	with Chimera scaling 
	</P>

	box-size was not divisible by 4 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realfilters 110 and 111 for
	iterative expansion of masks 
	</P>
	<LI><P>More binary releases</P>
</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>v1.4 - released 06/2003</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Substantial improvements were made
	to EMAN's parallelism. When used on small particles on a large
	number of processors, the previous versions of EMAN would run at
	less than 100% capacity on each processor. The new version should
	run at 100% on fairly large numbers of CPUs. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Python support - EMAN now
	officially supports Python scripting. Some very powerful operations
	can be performed with some very simple (and easy) scripts. Just to
	give you the flavor, here's a quick example which will compare
	class-averages to projections: 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">qindex - a program for very basic
	indexing of 2D crystal images was added. This program may be
	enhanced in future, depending on community response. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fitctf - improvements in fitting
	quality and accuracy. May still have problems with some CCD data. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">procpdb.py - a script for basic
	manipulation of PDB files, designed largely for use with <I>foldhunter</I>
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">foldhunter - new option added to
	generate rotated/translated PDB files corresponding to the best fits
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">multirefine - now permits a
	different symmetry to be specified for each model. This is still an
	experimental option.
